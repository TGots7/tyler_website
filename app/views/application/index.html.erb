I get excited over a simple Youtube ad that compels me not to press skip or a Budweiser Superbowl commercial that makes me emotional over a dog and horses friendship. I love working with people who motivate me to learn more and perform better. I've always been an early adopter of technology and am constantly looking forward to the next big trend which will shape our lives in this ever-evolving world.</p><h5 class="text-center">How I got here</h5><p class="lead"> Being a professional hockey player who has worked in marketing in both North America and Europe has provided me with experience in interacting with people of different cultures and speaking at highly publicized events. Hockey also instilled in me a desire to excel at all endeavors I take on. I have a life long history of striving in a team environment and being a leader who helps drive my team to surpass our goals. I played and worked for an organization that developed from the smallest budget in the country of Denmark to the largest, one with great media interaction and sponsorship growth. I crave learning and personal growth. My days consist of drinking countless cups of coffee while I read, learn, and try to improve myself. On top of staying healthy and traveling the world, I have spent my time since college taking professional development workshops and extended learning courses. Web development, marketing, and finance courses are what generally draw my attention.</p></div><div class="col-lg-4"><blockquote class="quote"> The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago.

The consumer today wants pictures and video, they are bored with reading. They are looking for an experience and a connection, making it vital for brands to offer this desire to the consumer in order to engage them.</p><p class="lead">For an early adopter like me, the evolving ways to communicate and interact with a consumer is exciting. It is easier than ever to reach the consumer, but harder than ever to hold their attention. Analytics has more of an important role in our decision making than ever before. I love being creative and cutting edge, but it is important for me to do so with the backing of the numbers. Analytics can guide innovative ideas into success- because we all want the proper ROI on our work.</p></div></div></div><div class="row justify-content-center"><div class="col-md-6"><div class="email_box"><h2 class='text-center' id="call_to_action">#CALL-TO-ACTION</h2><h5 class='text-center' id="call_to_action2">Sample direct responsive email - About me</h5><div class="row justify-content-center"><div class="email text-center"> <%= form_for @user do |f| %> <%= f.text_field :name, :placeholder => "Name", :class => "input-box" %><br> <%= f.text_field :email, :placeholder => "Email", :class => "input-box" %><br> <%= f.submit "STRATEGIC BUTTON", :class => "email-button" %> <% end %></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section class="content-section-c" id="content-section-c"><div class="container"><div class="row justify-content-center text-center"><div class="col-md-6"><h2 class="section-heading-c">Design</h2></div></div><div class="row justify-content-center"><div class="col-md-6"><p class="lead">My interest in design has exponentially grown over the past few years. The realization of how many websites and apps there are on the internet that are simply un-intriguing to the user makes my drive that much more powerful. The missed opportunities they encompass reignited my interest in creating engaging, interactive web projects. The importance of concise, informative, and affective design feeds into my creative side which drives me to have fun while designing different forms of media. It is rewarding to create beautiful work that is meaningful, useful, and engages the consumer. The quote below blends perfectly into the design world. An individual shouldn't have to think to use your product, they should just have the pleasure of doing so.</p></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="row justify-content-center text-center"><div class="col gotto-marry"><h4 class="lang-title">PHP</h4></div><div class="col wish-list"><h4 class="lang-title">Sinatra</h4></div><div class="col recipe"><h5 class="ror">Ruby On Rails</h5></div></div><div class="row justify-content-center text-center"><div class="col email-square"><h5 class="email-square-title">PHOTOSHOP</h5></div><div class="col storypage"><h4 class="js_jquery">JS/jQuery</h4></div><div class="col gif"><h4 class="adobe">ADOBE</h4></div></div></div></div><div class="row justify-content-center"><div class="col-sm-7 text-center quote-2"><blockquote class="margin-override">“Any product that needs a manual to work is broken."<cite> Elon Musk</cite></blockquote></div></div></section> <footer><div class="container"><div class="row justify-content-center text-center"><div class="col-md-10"><ul class="list-inline"><li class="list-inline-item"> <a href="#" class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm hvr-float-shadow">HOME</a></li><li class="footer-menu-divider list-inline-item">&sdot;</li><li class="list-inline-item"> <a href="#content-section-a" class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm hvr-float-shadow">BACKGROUND</a></li><li class="footer-menu-divider list-inline-item">&sdot;</li><li class="list-inline-item"> <a href="#content-section-b" class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm hvr-float-shadow">MARKETING</a></li><li class="footer-menu-divider list-inline-item">&sdot;</li><li class="list-inline-item"> <a href="contact" class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm hvr-float-shadow">CONTACT</a></li></ul><p class="copyright small">Copyright &copy; Tyler Gotto 2017.
